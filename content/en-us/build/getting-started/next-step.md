Now you have experienced the deployment of your first Phat Contract and invoked it on the serverless Phala computing cloud.

Your next step can be:

- Begin with [stateless applications](/en-us/build/stateless/intro/) and learn how to use Phat Contract's unique capabilities like
  - send HTTP requests;
  - handle users' requests with no gas fee and low latency;
- Learn where to [store your contract states](/en-us/build/stateful/storage-hierarchy/) including
  - store contract states on-chain;
  - store your data in decentralized storage;
  - use local memory to cache the data;
- Learn about the [infrastructure](/en-us/build/infrastructure/blockchain-detail/) to know where your contract is deployed and how your privacy is protected.
