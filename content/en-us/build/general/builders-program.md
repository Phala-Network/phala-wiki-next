## ***About the Phala Builders Program***
*Funding and supporting innovative projects building with the Phala Compute Cloud via Phat Contract.*

The Phala Builders Program provides funding, guidance, and support to developers that want to build high-value projects with Phat Contract, and add functionality to Phat Contract itself.


---

### **Why you should apply:**

**You want to Build Impossible Dapps**
-    You want to push the limits of what smart contracts are capable of by incorporating an off-chain computation solution that utilizes a self-executing and tamper-proof model.

**You care about Decentralization**
-    You’re passionate about the need for decentralized web services and user-controlled digital infrastructure.

**You need a Scalable Trustless Infrastructure**
-    You’re seeking a computation solution that can handle any level of compute demand, and perform your computation securely, privately, and trustlessly.

### **What do we offer?**

**Funding**
- Up to 50k$ USD value in PHA token, paid out on-chain at agreed-upon intervals dictated by the Builder Agreement.

**Technical Assistance**
- Deep technical support from lead Phat Contract developers during the design, testing, and deployment phases of project development.

**Marketing and Network Support**
- Phala will promote your project through our own channels and within our community, and make introductions to relevant ecosystem partners. We will make sure your developed application receives the attention it deserves.

### **Guidelines for Potential Applicants**

The Phala Builders Program supports high-quality teams that have a solid understanding of the Phat Contract platform and a clear vision of how they will utilize Phat Contract within their project. Projects that come into the application process with a MVP or some level of existing development with Phat Contract are more likely to be successful in securing funding.

#### **What we look for:**

**Compelling Teams**
- Teams with strong technical backgrounds that have a clear vision for their project, including a growth strategy and structured plan of development.

**Innovative Ideas**
- As Phat Contract represents a new tool in the kit of Web3 developers, we’re looking to support projects that seek to push the envelope of what can be built on blockchain. We want to support new ideas that add something novel to the space.

**Contributions to Phat Contract Tooling**
- Phat Contract is a highly composable developer resource, we value teams that seek to build out new tooling and primitives within the SDK.

### **Funding Levels**

**Tier One**
*Maximum Value: $20,000 USD value paid in PHA*
Criteria: Development of a compelling project involving significant usage of Phat Contract.

**Tier Two**
*Maximum Value: $50,000 USD value paid in PHA*
Criteria: Development of a compelling project or projects involving significant usage of Phat Contract, and the development of new tooling for Phat Contract.

## **Application Process**
*The application process for both tier one and tier two funding is the same, however tier two applicants can expect a more rigorous evaluation.*
