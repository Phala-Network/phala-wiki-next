## An Overview

Phala is a trustless cloud computing solution for the next generation's internet, the [Web3](https://web3.foundation/). We build on [Parity's Substrate](https://www.parity.io/technologies/substrate/) and operate in the Polkadot ecosystem on the [Kusama](https://kusama.network/) parachain.
\
Phala tackles the privacy issue of legacy blockchain solutions operated in a cloud environment by decoupling the computation from the chain to off-chain secure workers (miners).
\
\
Our secure workers utilize specific TEE ([Trusted Execution Environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_execution_environment)) hardware that ensures confidentiality, security, and performance of blockchain computation. Furthermore, our code is all open source.

## The Architecture

In general, Phala Network consists of the Phala blockchain and the off-chain TEE runtime. Also, we introduce a bridge relayer to connect them. So a full stack of a Phala node contains the following three components.

- `phala-node`: The Substrate-based blockchain node
- `pRuntime`: The TEE runtime. Contracts run in `pRuntime`
- `pherry`: The Substrate-TEE bridge relayer. Connects the blockchain and `pRuntime`

### Transaction Security

The core insight of our system design is that the blockchain can serve as a canonical input source for the TEE. Although attackers cannot peek at the TEE, they can trick the contracts in the TEE by forging transactions or replaying/reordering valid transactions. It is important to ensure that confidential contracts only accept valid transactions and process transactions in an expected order. Thatâ€™s why we introduce Phala blockchain and connect it to the `pRuntime` via `pherry`.

As illustrated, the Phala blockchain serves as a canonical source of valid transactions. Only submitted transactions can be accepted by `pRuntime`, and they will be processed in the same order as they are on the blockchain. We implement a light validation client in `pRuntime` to determine whether valid transactions are accepted in an expected order. Also, a key rotation mechanism will be introduced to prevent the replay of historical transactions. The great thing is that `pRuntime` hides all these complicated implementation details from you to implement confidential contracts like developing ordinary programs.

`pherry` works as the bridge between Phala blockchain and `pRuntime`. It ensures that all the transactions on the blockchain are faithfully forwarded to `pRuntime` and all the TEE instances are running an unmodified version of `pRuntime`. While it is worth noting that `pRuntime` does not trust `pherry`, it will still validate every block and transaction it receives from `pherry`.
