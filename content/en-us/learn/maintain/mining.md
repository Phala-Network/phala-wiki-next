Miners, also referred to as "Workers" in Phala blockchain, provide computing power to the Phala Network. Anyone with the appropriate hardware can participate.

This section provides some theory about the mining concepts of Phala and additional background information.

## Worker Registration

Registration is required before a worker or gatekeeper can join the network. After that, any parties with TEE-supported devices can serve as workers. To register as a validated worker in the blockchain, TEE runners need to run `pRuntime` and let it send a signed attestation report to gatekeepers.

`pRuntime` requests a Remote Attestation with a hash of the `WorkerInfo` committed in the attestation report. `WorkerInfo` includes the public key of `IdentityKey` and `EcdhKey` and other data collected from the enclave. By verifying the report, gatekeepers can know the hardware information of workers and ensure that they are running unmodified `pRuntime`.

## Remote Attestation

The attestation report is relayed to the blockchain by `register_worker()` call. The blockchain has the trusted certificates to validate the attestation report. It validates:

1. The signature of the report is correct;
2. The embedded hash in the report matches the hash of the submitted `WorkerInfo`;

`register_worker()` is called by workers, and a worker can only be assigned contracts when it has certain amounts of staking PHA tokens. On the blockchain there is a `WorkerState` map from the worker to the `WorkerInfo` entry. Gatekeepers will update the `WorkerState` map after they receive and verify the submitted `WorkerInfo`.

## Offline Worker Detection

The `pRuntime` of a worker is regularly required to answer the online challenge as a heartbeat event on chain. The blockchain detects the liveness of workers by monitoring the interval of their heartbeat events. A worker is punished with the penalty of his staking tokens if it goes offline during a contract execution.
