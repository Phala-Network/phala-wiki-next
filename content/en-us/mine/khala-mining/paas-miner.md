## Worker on Vultr

> This guide will show you how to set up your worker on the `VULTR Bare Metal Simplifiedâ„¢ Intel E-2286G` Instance. For mining on your own hardware check our guide [here](/en-us/mine/khala-mining/hardware-requirements/#requirements-checklist).

## Before Getting Started

1. Sign up on <a href="https://www.vultr.com/?ref=9108833-8H"><img alt="VULTR Bare Metal" src="/images/docs/quick-start/mine-phala/signet__on-dark-blue-bg.png" width="30"> [Vultr](https://vultr.com).
2. Enter your [billing information](https://my.vultr.com/billing/).
3. Request to [increase your limit](https://my.vultr.com/billing/#billinglimits) may be required.

> Increasing the credit depends on the cloud provider's support's response time.

## Deploy Instance

After successfully signing up and increasing your credit limit, it is time to pick the correct instance.

* Go to [Deploy](https://my.vultr.com/deploy/)
  - Select 'Bare Metal'
  - Pick an available location geographically closest to you.
  - Select `Intel E-2286G`
  - Choose the 64 bit OS Ubuntu 21.10 x64
  - Leave any remaining options as default.
  - Add a meaningful 'Server Hostname & Label'
  - You are ready to hit 'Deploy Now'
  - Wait for 5-15 minutes: Get a cup of coffee :coffee: until your instance is ready

## Instance Settings

Once your new instance is displayed as 'Running,' there are currently no additional steps required to adjust the machine's BIOS. The instance works out of the box.

> _Optional:_ To optimize the worker's score, you can reboot the instance, head over to the console, and enter the BIOS with F11, to adjust the BIOS settings mentioned in [this guide](/en-us/mine/khala-mining/hardware-requirements/#check-your-bios).

You can get the correct drivers from our guide [here](/en-us/mine/khala-mining/hardware-requirements/#supported-operating-systems) under the Ubuntu 21.10 tab.

Once the drivers are installed, you may now turn your instance into a Phala worker.
