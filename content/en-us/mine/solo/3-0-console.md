> We highly recommend reading about our [staking mechanism](/en-us/learn/maintain/mining-staking) before using the [Phala App](https://app.phala.network/en/mining/).

Miners and pool owners can use the Phala App to manage Workers/ Miners and StakePools. It also provides an overview of the status of all the managed Miners and Stake Pools.

## Prerequisites
>
> 1. The same [Khala account](/en-us/general/phala-wallet/polkadot-extension-guide/) the Miners run on, as the pool Owner and Miner operator.
> 2. `miner public key`: The Miner must be ready and synced. This miner must use the same Khala Account as the one you use for the Khala App.

If you do not have a wallet yet, [create one](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fkhala-api.phala.network%2Fws#/accounts) (+ Add account) and install the [Polkadot{.js} extension](https://polkadot.js.org/extension) for your browser.
