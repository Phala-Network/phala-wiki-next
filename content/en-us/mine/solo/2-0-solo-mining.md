## Get the Miner Ready

This section shows you how to set up your Phala mining CLI, the respective tools, and setting the last parameters for your drivers.

Execute the following command to get your miner ready to launch for mining.

```bash
sudo ~/solo-mining-scripts-main/phala.sh install
```

>`phala.sh` will update the miner to use your newly installed driver settings and configuration. This is required for first-time miners or whenever you update or change your driver configuration for this change to take effect.
