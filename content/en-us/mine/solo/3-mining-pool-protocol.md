## What is Phala Management Development Component?

Phala Management Development Component is an open-source development component which meant to serve Phala workers. It provides a Cloud Native RPC interface to manage Phala Workers' lifecycle through Redis. It can be utilized by:

- Public Mining Pool, a third-party service which enables its members to share their processing power and split the reward according to the amount of work they contributed;
- Mining Cluster, a private network consisted of multiple TEE Workers.

Noted that Phala Management Development Component is a development component which can be customized by developers, and it should not be directly used by end users.

## Hardware Requirements

Unlike normal Worker which runs in SGX, Phala Management Development Component itself \***_requires no TEE (i.e., SGX) capabilities_**. We list the recommended hardwares as follow.
