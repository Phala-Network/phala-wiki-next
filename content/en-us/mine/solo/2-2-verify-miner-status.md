## Verify the Status of your Miner

You can see the synchronization progress at any time of your miner.
Check your miner's status with:

```bash
sudo phala status
```

Your miner's status shows the
* `node name`
* `number of cores`
* `gas account and balance`
* `StakePool account`
* `Worker public key`
* `Alarm of node loss syncing`

> A warning will be sent if your gas account balance is under 2 PHA so you can recharge your GAS account on time.
