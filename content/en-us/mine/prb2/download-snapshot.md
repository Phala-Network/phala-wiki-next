## Download a Snapshot

> :information: If your node is close to the newest block height (about several hours to catch up) or already caught up, you don't need to do anything; sit and wait.

Download the snapshot using the torrent (updated at 4/30/2022): [here](/files/prb-next-snapshot-2022-04-30.tar.gz.torrent)

The download will take a while, as the file is large. Get some :coffee: in the meantime.

> :information: The snapshot archive is ~500 GB; if you don't have enough space, consider extracting to an external storage.

To extract the file execute:

```bash
tar -xvzf prb-next-snapshot-2022-04-30.tar.gz
```
