## Transfer PHA: Ethereum <-> Khala

This tutorial takes the transfer of PHA from Ethereum to Khala as an example. You can also refer to this tutorial for other EVM <-> parachain bridge transfers.
<!-- > Note that you can directly transfer from Ethereum to other parachains, like Karura, with no need to transfer to Khala first and then from Khala to Karura. -->

1. Open [SubBridge](https://subbridge.io/), switch *From* chain to Khala, *To* chain to Karura, and choose `PHA` as the currency;
2. Connect the Source Chain (Khala)’s account, enter the transfer amount;
    > Note: Do not transfer all the token, you need to keep a certain fee in the account to ensure that it is not deleted.
3. Enter the receiving account on destination chain (Karura), note that it should be the Karura address. The destination account is your source account by default, you can click *Edit manually* to use other addresses;
4. Click *Transfer*;
5. Confirm pop-up window;
    > Note: A transfer fee of 0.0512 PHA will be charged for transferring from Khala to Karura. The bridge itself is completely free. This fee is used to pay the XCM fee of the Karura chain. It does not include the transaction fee of the Khala chain.
6. Click *Submit* to sign;

7. The transaction is sent from Khala, wait for the transaction to be confirmed;
8. Then you can go to destination chain’s wallet (in this case, [Karura Apps](https://apps.karura.network/portfolio)) to check whether you have received the token (PHA). If it is not received within 1 minute, you can go to the Khala chain explorer ([Subscan](https://khala.subscan.io/)) to check whether you have sent a transaction; if you have any questions, you can consult our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/phala).
