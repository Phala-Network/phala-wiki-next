## Overview

In this chapter, we try to give a brief introduction to the structure of Phala blockchain. In general, Phala Network consists of the Phala blockchain and the off-chain TEE runtime. Also, we introduce a bridge relayer to connect them. So a full stack of a Phala node contains the following three components.

- `phala-node`: The Substrate-based blockchain node
- `pRuntime`: The TEE runtime. Contracts run in `pRuntime`
- `pherry`: The Substrate-TEE bridge relayer. Connects the blockchain and `pRuntime`

(Phala architecture overview)

The core insight of our system design is that the blockchain can serve as a canonical input source for TEE. That is, although attackers cannot peek at TEE, they can trick the contracts in TEE by forging transactions or replaying/reordering valid transactions. It is important to ensure that confidential contracts only accept valid transactions and process transactions in an expected order. Thatâ€™s why we introduce Phala blockchain and connect it to the `pRuntime` via `pherry`.

As illustrated, the Phala blockchain serves as a canonical source of valid transactions. Only submitted transactions can be accepted by `pRuntime`, and they will be processed in the same order as they are on the blockchain. We implement a light validation client in `pRuntime` so it can determine whether valid transactions are accepted in an expected order. Also, a key rotation mechanism will be introduced to prevent the replay of historical transactions. The great thing is that `pRuntime` hides all these complicated implementation details from you so you can just implement confidential contracts like developing ordinary programs.

`pherry` works as the bridge between Phala blockchain and `pRuntime`. It ensures that all the transactions on the blockchain are faithfully forwarded to `pRuntime` and all the TEE instances are running an unmodified version of `pRuntime`. While it is worth noting that `pRuntime` does not trust `pherry`: it will still validate every block and transaction it receives from `pherry`.
